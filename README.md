# Hugging Face Transformers: GenAI LLMs, Fine-tuning, and Prompt Engineering

## Overview

This repository contains resources and examples related to Hugging Face Transformers, including fine-tuning techniques and prompt engineering for Generative AI language models (LLMs).

## About the PDF File

This repository includes a PDF version of the Jupyter notebook titled `QwenMath.pdf`. The PDF was created because the Hugging Face (HF) access key was deleted prior to uploading the notebook. As a result, the notebook may not function as intended without the access key. The PDF serves as a static representation of the notebook's content for reference purposes.

### Important Note for iPhone Users

When viewing the PDF on an iPhone, you may encounter an issue where only the first page is displayed. To view the complete content, please download the PDF file and open it with a dedicated PDF viewer app.

If you need to run the notebook, please ensure you have a valid Hugging Face access key and set it up in your environment.
